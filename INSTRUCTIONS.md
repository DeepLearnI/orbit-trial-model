# Welcome to Foundations Orbit Online Trial

*Estimated time: 30 minutes*

In this tutorial we will go through an example of what Data Science teams and business managers need to do to manage machine learning models in a production environment. We will go through this trial in a gamified setting where you will be in control of what actions to take with the ultimate goal of solving a business problem.

We’re providing you with a fully-managed environment so you can focus on understanding and solving the challenges associated with hosting live models. This trial environment provides you with
* An in-browser Python IDE with popular data science & ML packages pre-installed
* The Foundations Orbit GUI 
* A tutorial with example code & data
* A simulated production environment
* Free cloud compute

## Step 1 of 9: Introduction to the problem

Let’s imagine you work at a meal-kit company, called **Hello, Food**. The business model is to prepare & deliver the ingredients for meals every week to subscribed customers for them to cook themselves. 

<placeholder for log>
  
**Hello, Food**'s revenues are falling as customer attrition has overtaken new subscriptions. In an attempt to retain customers, the company has decided to earmark some money to start a retention initiative by sending special offers to a subset of the customer base.

**You are in charge of this initiative! Good luck!**

Here are some facts about the business:
* Revenue per customer: $xxx per month
* Number of customers (as of the start of this trial): xxx
* Monthly growth rate: xxx% 
* Monthly attrition rate (as of the start of this trial): xxx%
* Special offer capacity*: xxx%
